\section{Some math}

\marginnote{%
	This formula is also known as \emph{Pythagorean Theorem}, albeit it is
	usually written with the variables $a$, $b$, and $c$.
}
Here follows some tests for typesetting math.
Note how we use the \texttt{\\marginnote} command to add some pretty notes
which appear in the margin.
This is quite nice, as it allows a more narrow width of the text body without
the page looking too sparse\footnote{This is a footnote}.
Here comes our first equation
\begin{align}
	z^2 & = x^2 + y^2             \\
	z   & = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \, .
\end{align}

\pagebreak
\marginnote{%
	Did you know?
	The discrete fourier transformation shown in equation \ref{eqn:dft} is the
	backbone of the modern information-society.
}
And here comes some more math, this time a discrete Fourier transformation
(DFT) which is a little bit more sophisticated than the last example%
\footnote{More is always better!}:
\begin{align}
	f_m =  \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} x_k \, e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{2n} mk } \label{eqn:dft}
	\qquad
	m = 0, \dotsc, 2n-1 \, .
\end{align}
For words of science, see \cite{botsch2010polygon}.
Unfortunately, that book has nothing about \glspl{wolf}.
